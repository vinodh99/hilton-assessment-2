Steps to run the app,

1. Clone the repositiory using the command git clone https://github.com/vinodh99/hilton-assessment-2.git
2. Open your command prompt and change your directory to the downloaded folder.
3. Run the command "npm i && npm start".
4. It should start running on the local host 3000.
5. Enter "y" and press enter if it asks to run the app on another port (It will ask you to run on different port if another application is running on port 3000 already).


I could have programmed the application only using react and lifecycle components but to make things easy and understandable, I have used Redux.
